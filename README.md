OrganizerConsoleApp
===================

The organizer is written in C# and has no user interface. It's a simple console application that tries to follow the best practices for object oriented design.  The user can choose what kind of event he/she wishes to enter and can browse from events already in the organizer. Additionally the application will delete older entries and will not display events too far in the future.
